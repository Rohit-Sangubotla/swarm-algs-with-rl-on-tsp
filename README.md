This repository is the implementation of ACO, AntQ and some other algorithms, on the Travelling Salesman Problem. The code compares the algorithms on random sets of cities, with the number of cities being 5, 25, 50 and 100. The results for ACO and AntQ are in ./results, and the results for PSO and PSOQ (for which the code is not in this respository) are stored as well. The algorithms are also run on some standard datasets of cities including oliver30, berlin52, etc. The code for AntQ and ACO has been taken from https://github.com/mike-kaonashi/antq-demo.
